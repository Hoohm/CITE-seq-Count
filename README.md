# CITE-seq-Count
A python package that allows to count antibody TAGS from a [CITE-seq](https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.4380) and/or [cell hashing](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/12/21/237693) experiment.


IMPORTANT NEWS
------------------------------------------
There was a major bug in version 1.3.4 of CITE-seq-Count. The results were in read counts and not in UMI counts.

This is fixed in version 1.4.0 or above. Please rerun your data as this might provide a cleaner result for your data.

Here is the website referencing the wetlab protocols needed https://cite-seq.com/

Installation
-------------------------------------------

```
pip install CITE-seq-Count==1.4.4
```
