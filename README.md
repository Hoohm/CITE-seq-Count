IMPORTANT NEWS
------------------------------------------
There was a major bug in version 1.3.4 of CITE-seq-Count. The results where in read counts and not in UMI counts.

This is fixed in version 1.4.0 or above. Please rerun your data as this might provide a cleaner result for your data.

Here is the website referencing the wetlab protocols needed https://cite-seq.com/
